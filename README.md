About the App
The Cardiokol React Native App is a mobile application that allows users to screen themselves for heart arrhythmias. The app uses the device's camera to record the user's heart rate and analyzes the data to detect arrhythmias. If an arrhythmia is detected, the app prompts the user to contact a healthcare professional.

The app was built using React Native, a popular cross-platform mobile development framework, and integrates with Cardiokol's backend APIs to securely store and analyze user data.
